# Dark Mode Button

A stylish and animated dark mode toggle button implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Smooth transition animation between light and dark modes
- Modern and minimalist design
- Easy to integrate into any web project
- Responsive design

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html     # Main HTML file
├── style.css      # Styles and animations
└── script.js      # Toggle functionality
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwastikSharma15/Dark-Mode-Button.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the button in action.

3. To integrate into your own project, copy the following files:
   - `index.html` (button markup)
   - `style.css` (styles and animations)
   - `script.js` (toggle functionality)

## How It Works

The dark mode button uses CSS transitions and transforms for smooth animations. The toggle state is handled by JavaScript, which updates the button's appearance and can be extended to apply dark mode styles to your entire website.

## Customization

You can customize the button's appearance by modifying the CSS variables in `style.css`.
